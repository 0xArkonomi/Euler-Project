# Getting started 


## 0-10 Problems
## Problem 1  
If we list all the natural numbers below **10** that are multiples of **3** or **5**, we get **3, 5, 6** and **9**.The sum of these multiples is **23**.  
Find the sum of all the multiples of **3** or **5** below**100** .

"Give it a shot yourself, and if you get stuck, don't worry; here is the [solution](euler_01.js)."


## Problem 2
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with **1** and **2**, the first **10** terms will be: 
        $1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...$

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Problem 3
The prime factors of $13195$ are $5, 7, 13$ and $29$.
What is the largest prime factor of the number $600851475143$?

## Problem 4
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two $3$-digit numbers is  
$9009 = 91 Ã— 99$
.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two $2$-digit numbers.
